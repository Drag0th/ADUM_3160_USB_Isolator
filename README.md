# ADUM_3160_USB_Isolator
Faulty USB devices can cause serious problems, including damaging USB ports or even the motherboard. Certain devices, such as USB killers, are designed specifically to overload or destroy USB circuits. Even ordinary USB measurement tools can introduce issues, producing inaccurate readings due to ground loops or causing short circuits if there’s a fault.

A 2.5kV USB 2.0 isolator provides a simple and effective solution. It separates the data and power lines electrically, protecting both the computer and connected devices. The isolator supports full-speed USB 2.0 data transfer at 12 Mbps and provides up to 200 mA of power, making it compatible with a wide range of USB peripherals while ensuring safety and reliability.
